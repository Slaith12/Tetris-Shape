homework:

improve UI
update readme

level editor

maybe:
consider sfx

Original plans for levels:
level 1: learn basic mechanics
level 2: harder version of level 1
level 3: mid-air objective
level 4: harder version of level 3
level 5: harder version of level 4 (meant to help the player get used to the concept)
level 6: 0 buffer level (single objective)
level 7: harder version of level 6
level 8: buffers become barriers to make towering to the objective harder (not borders)
level 9: level 5 but with the new concept from level 8
level 10: put objectives close to top
level 11: a super hard level that is eventually moved to being the last challenge level AFTER getting nerfed. How did I originally think it was easy?
level 12: seperate objective regions
level 13: 
level 14: 
level 15: thin line objective
level 16: 
level 17: entire board is either objective or buffer
level 18: chess board (alternating objective and buffer)
level 19: 
level 20: secret grade
(the only reason the last 4 levels became challenge levels was so that there was a place to put the old level 11.)

desired difficulty curve: exponential
